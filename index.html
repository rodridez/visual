                <div class="article"><p>In our role as designers, it is imperative that we consciously construct the right window through which individuals perceive and engage with the world, aligning it with the desired social structure. As a collective of creative minds, we possess an unique ability to perceive and capture people's attention through our creations, serving as a powerful tool to address and shed a light on pressing social issues. Heftmann's wisdom highlights the significance of understanding user preferences and conducting thorough research when tackling problems, emphasizing the need for a user-centric approach. Building on this, Butler's commentary adds a layer of responsibility, reminding us that every choice we make as designers carries consequential weight, influencing both the user experience and societal impact. Furthermore, the importance of historical awareness and a deep understanding of human behavior becomes evident in our quest to envision the future, acknowledging that the past and present shape the trajectory of our designs and their broader societal implications.</p></div>

As designers, we must not forget to create the right window(metaphor) that aligns with the desired social structure. In the words of Octavia Butler, when we craft this window, we should also consider the future."</p>

                <div class="article"><p>In the realm of interaction design, designers have the responsibility of bridging the gap between humans and computers. With that said, they must inclusively consider the diverse needs of users, even in the face of oversight by major corporations that may not prioritize inclusivity as much as they should. Simplicity, when designing, becomes a guiding principle for achieving clarity and universal understanding. Contrary to common belief, overutilizing interactions may lead to more issues for the user, as there can be unwanted consequences that come out of seemingly simple design decisions. A good example of that is the positive response to the fidgetability of tech gadgets, serving as an emotional support that wasn't necessarily designed with such intentions. On the flip side, negative and unintended outcomes may result from decisions based on biased data.</p></div>

Often, fidgeting occurs to reduce stress or anxiety, helping calm and ease the user's emotions. Considering that technology is omnipresent, and can itself cause stress and anxiety for users, I observed that perhaps the ‘fidgetability’ of gadgets is very much intentional. The gadget performs its primary function, for example, AirPods allow us to listen to music.

Perhaps this is because many major Indian corporations may not prioritize it as much as they should, often making assumptions about their target audience without conducting in-depth research.

                            However, as I delved deeper into my work, particularly in product design for medical equipment, I came to understand the profound significance of inclusion and why it should be a fundamental criterion in the design industry."</p>

Should we designers try our best to remove our subjectivity from our creations as it was suggested by the Modernist ideas? In his text entitled “...” Martens would say no. His theory emphasizes an union between form and function. Aesthetic and usability are not mutually exclusive, and factors such as context, environment, and mood play a defining role in the creators decisions. Martens' critique of monotonous art without self-expression challenges the uniformity of modernist designs, raising questions about the balance between expressiveness and thoughtful individual choices in design trends. For us designers, the challenge lies in making intentional design decisions rather than merely conforming to popular trends.</p></div>

My interpretation of this was that he may have been critiquing the uniformity that comes with modernist designs (sleek, minimalist). I began to wonder about the opposite end of that spectrum- when design is expressive but lacks thoughtful choices which reflect individuality. Looking through the trends in graphic design from this past year, it’s interesting how many of these I recognise from my day to day life.

Therefore, contemplating the future of the web is an important task for designers. In his compelling discourse on the web's grain, Frank Chimeros underscores the significance of embracing adaptability and advocates for a fresh perspective in designing for the ever-evolving web. Contrary to the common perception of the internet as an unregulated information hub, it functions as a managed network. This is why, when designing for a new web, prioritizing transparency, user privacy, and the incorporation of ethical practices is crucial. A meaningful way to conceptualize the web is by drawing parallels between web design and architecture. This perspective portrays them not just as digital spaces but as homes to communities, thoughts, and unique approaches, enriching the user experience with a sense of virtual dwelling.</p></div>

                        <p class="original-text">"In a world of dynamic digital design, Frank Chimeros iterates how we should embrace adaptability and by questioning the convenience-driven tech landscape, it encourages a fresh perspective on designing for the ever-evolving web as well as navigating the complexities of our digital age. The visual metaphor at the end comparing the web to the ocean, “and actually be pleased it looks like it could go on forever”, I thought that was a beautiful reference - one that summed up the endless possibilities of the web eloquently."</p>

I do think, though, that the text could benefit from providing concrete examples or case studies to illustrate its points. While the conceptual framework is well-articulated, specific instances would make the parallels between web design and architecture more tangible and relatable for readers."</p>

            <div class="paragraph">

                <div class="article"><p>In the day to day complexity of journalism, technology, and design, our assumptions, biases, and perspectives leak into the very core of our work. To create products that are truly inclusive and equitable, we must remain vigilant in recognizing and addressing these shaping forces. The danger lies in the 'unconscious,' the very nature of biases deeply ingrained within us, limited by our backgrounds and perspectives. Decisions made in our daily work can be subtly influenced by biases and assumptions, impacting everything from the selection of data to its visual representation. One example of this would be the seemingly unoffensive representation of people as visual dots in a pool chart, which could be perceived as offensive when considering war booklogs representing people as dots as well. It's a profound realization that our individual perspectives carry inherent biases, and only through acknowledging the diverse viewpoints of others can we begin to unravel the limitations of our understanding.</p></div>

This affects everything from the data chosen to how it's shown. Biases, even in small design choices, can lead to exclusion. The article showcases efforts by some companies to tackle biases and emphasizes the need for diverse perspectives in design for fairness and inclusivity."</p>

I think it would be very challenging for both data analyst/scientist and designer/visualizer to embrace every diversity in perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds to create a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the world. Data can always provide misleading information (eg. Example with Siri) and I wonder how it can be avoided. How could we come up with data that satisfies people with various perspectives? "</p>

But at the same time an unconscious bias is so common, with the limitation of our own background and perspective, it is so easy to be not aware of certain stereotypical thoughts that are hidden deep in the subconscious."</p>

                        <p class="original-text">"As we mentioned during class, the idea of bias and assumptions can sometimes permeate our decision making as designers to the extent that we may offend or exclude certain groups of individuals. Shapes, such as dots, to draw representation for individual humans have a long history of used for war logs and sectarian sweep in the past. There are instantces where it is appropriate to draw out the entirety of the human figure to evoke a sense of empathy from viewers but can be ineffective when the singular human figure does not represent one single individual. How can designers be able to design empathetically but also creatively or is this the case where creativity comes last?"</p>
