                    <h2>Design, Form & Function</h2>
                    <p>The dynamic relationship between beauty and function, freedom and order in graphic design has evolved over time, with changing philosophies and trends. Should we designers try our best to remove our subjectivity from our creations as it was suggested by the Modernist ideas? In his text entitled “...” Martens would say no. His theory emphasizes an union between form and function. Aesthetic and usability are not mutually exclusive, and factors such as context, environment, and mood play a defining role in the creators decisions. Martens' critique of monotonous art without self-expression challenges the uniformity of modernist designs, raising questions about the balance between expressiveness and thoughtful individual choices in design trends. For us designers, the challenge lies in making intentional design decisions rather than merely conforming to popular trends.</p>
                    <h2>Design & Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>In the realm of interaction design, designers have the responsibility of bridging the gap between humans and computers. With that said, they must inclusively consider the diverse needs of users, even in the face of oversight by major corporations that may not prioritize inclusivity as much as they should. Simplicity, when designing, becomes a guiding principle for achieving clarity and universal understanding. Contrary to common belief, overutilizing interactions may lead to more issues for the user, as there can be unwanted consequences that come out of seemingly simple design decisions. A good example of that is the positive response to the fidgetability of tech gadgets, serving as an emotional support that wasn't necessarily designed with such intentions. On the flip side, negative and unintended outcomes may result from decisions based on biased data.</p>
                    <h2>Design & Society</h2>
                    <p>In our role as designers, it is imperative that we consciously construct the right window through which individuals perceive and engage with the world, aligning it with the desired social structure. As a collective of creative minds, we possess an unique ability to perceive and capture people's attention through our creations, serving as a powerful tool to address and shed a light on pressing social issues. Heftmann's wisdom highlights the significance of understanding user preferences and conducting thorough research when tackling problems, emphasizing the need for a user-centric approach. Building on this, Butler's commentary adds a layer of responsibility, reminding us that every choice we make as designers carries consequential weight, influencing both the user experience and societal impact. Furthermore, the importance of historical awareness and a deep understanding of human behavior becomes evident in our quest to envision the future, acknowledging that the past and present shape the trajectory of our designs and their broader societal implications.</p>
                    <h2>Design & Life</h2>
                    <p>The essence of humanity lies in our remarkable capacity to navigate an uncertain future and extract insights from diverse perspectives. Recently, I (the designer) encountered another (yet seasoned) designer who chose to spotlight the losses rather than the victories in his journey, an approach that surprisingly left me inspired. Witnessing the real-life implications and the rollercoaster of building a design studio added a layer of authenticity that resonated with me. Such contrast is a real factor in my life as a design professional. Sometimes I find myself in a low, stuck in trivial dilemmas such as my lack of ability in defining my own profession and if such definition truly matters. Sometimes a high, like when I see a new perspective on my processes, like recently when I was introduced to fluid identity design, challenging conventional notions of what websites, identities, and books should be. While I Increasingly walk anxiously under the looming shadow of technology over design. Provoking black-mirror-y indagations as if there will ever be an artificial replacement of (my) human abilities. Would machines be able to navigate the uncertainties of the future? Or should I start defining myself as an AI designer?</p>
                    <h2>Design & Web</h2>
                    <p>A great part of our modern lives involves the web, and most of the work we do as designers is interconnected with it. Therefore, contemplating the future of the web is an important task for designers. In his compelling discourse on the web's grain, Frank Chimeros underscores the significance of embracing adaptability and advocates for a fresh perspective in designing for the ever-evolving web. Contrary to the common perception of the internet as an unregulated information hub, it functions as a managed network. This is why, when designing for a new web, prioritizing transparency, user privacy, and the incorporation of ethical practices is crucial. A meaningful way to conceptualize the web is by drawing parallels between web design and architecture. This perspective portrays them not just as digital spaces but as homes to communities, thoughts, and unique approaches, enriching the user experience with a sense of virtual dwelling.</p>
                    <h2>Design and Bias</h2>
                    <p>In the day to day complexity of journalism, technology, and design, our assumptions, biases, and perspectives leak into the very core of our work. To create products that are truly inclusive and equitable, we must remain vigilant in recognizing and addressing these shaping forces. The danger lies in the 'unconscious,' the very nature of biases deeply ingrained within us, limited by our backgrounds and perspectives. Decisions made in our daily work can be subtly influenced by biases and assumptions, impacting everything from the selection of data to its visual representation. One example of this would be the seemingly unoffensive representation of people as visual dots in a pool chart, which could be perceived as offensive when considering war booklogs representing people as dots as well. It's a profound realization that our individual perspectives carry inherent biases, and only through acknowledging the diverse viewpoints of others can we begin to unravel the limitations of our understanding.</p>
